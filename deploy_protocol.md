1. **`DEPLOY_PROTOCOL.md`**: A "Cheat Sheet" that explains exactly how we solved the problem (The "Nuclear Fix") so you never forget.
2. **`easy_push.ps1`**: A double-click script. You never have to type `git add` or `git commit` in the terminal again. You just run this, type your message, and it handles the rest.

### 1. The Cheat Sheet (Save as `DEPLOY_PROTOCOL.md`)

```markdown
#  Qwen3 Studio Deployment Protocol
**Status:** ACTIVE | **Protocol:** VIBE-SECURITY (Clean Push)

## ⚠️ The "Golden Rule" of GitHub
**NEVER** upload the following folders to GitHub. They are too heavy (8GB+) and will break the upload immediately.
- ❌ `.venv` (Virtual Environment)
- ❌ `Qwen3-TTS` (The AI Model)
- ❌ `_internal` (Build Artifacts)
- ❌ `temp_outputs` (WAV/MP3 files)

---

## ️ Scenario A: Daily Update (Everything is fine)
When you have made code changes and just want to save them:
1. Run `easy_push.ps1`
2. Enter a short message (e.g., "Updated launcher UI")
3. Done.

---

##  Scenario B: The "Emergency Reset" (If Git breaks)
If you see errors like **"LFS upload failed"** or **"File too large"**, follow this "Nuclear Option":

### Step 1: Update the Ignore List
Ensure `.gitignore` contains exactly this:
```text
dist/
build/
Output/
__pycache__/
*.spec
Qwen3-TTS/
qwen_tts/
.venv/
_internal/
temp_outputs/
saved_assets/
*.wav
*.mp3
*.log
app.lock
launcher.lock

```

### Step 2: The Nuclear Commands

Run these in PowerShell to wipe the memory and start fresh:

```powershell
# 1. Kill the broken history
Remove-Item -Path .git -Recurse -Force

# 2. Start fresh
git init

# 3. Add files (The ignore list will protect you)
git add .
git commit -m "Emergency Reset Release"

# 4. Force Push to the Official Repo
git branch -M main
git remote add origin [https://github.com/1verysimple-lab/Qwen3-Studio-Official.git](https://github.com/1verysimple-lab/Qwen3-Studio-Official.git)
git push -u --force origin main

```

---

###  Release Checklist

1. **Build:** Run `python build_distribution.py`
2. **Pack:** Run `installer_config.iss` with Inno Setup.
3. **Upload:** Drag `Pro_Studio_Setup_vX.X.exe` to GitHub Releases.
4. **Link:** Update `version.json` with the new link.

```

### 2. The Automation Script (Save as `easy_push.ps1`)

Save this file in your project folder. Next time you want to save your work, just **Right-Click > Run with PowerShell**.
